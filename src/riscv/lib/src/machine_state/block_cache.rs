//! The block cache maps certain physical addresses to contiguous sequences of instructions, or
//! 'blocks'. These blocks will never cross page boundaries.
//!
//! Blocks are sets of instructions that are often - but not always - executed immediately after each
//! other. The main exceptions to this are:
//! - instructions may trigger exceptions (e.g. `BadMemoryAccess` when interacting with memory)
//! - branching instructions
//!
//! Specifically, blocks that contain a backwards branching instruction will often terminate with
//! that instruction, and blocks that contain a forwards jump will often contain those internally.
//!
//! This is due to the recommended behaviour mentioned in the ISA:
//! > Software should also assume that backward branches will be predicted taken and forward branches
//! > as not taken, at least the first time they are encountered.
//!
//! Therefore, sets of instructions that form tight loops will naturally form a block, and
//! sequences that may branch elsewhere - but normally fall-through - also form a block.
//!
//! Blocks must never cross page boundaries, as two pages that lie next to each other in physical
//! memory have no guarantees of being consecutive in virtual memory - even if they are at one
//! point.
//!
//! # Determinism
//!
//! Some special care is required when thinking about block execution
//! with respect to determinism.
//!
//! Blocks fundamentally rely on being executed 'as a whole'. This is
//! required to be able to make the most of various optimisations we
//! can apply to groups of instructions, while ensuring that we are
//! compatible with the remaining infrastructure of the stepper at block
//! entry/exit.
//! For example, this could include something as simple as not
//! updating the step counter until we exit a block.
//!
//! Only ever running blocks when sufficient steps remain, however,
//! causes determinism issues. Namely, when insufficient steps remain
//! to run a block, what do we do?
//!
//! The obvious solution is to fall back to the instruction cache, and
//! continue our *fetch/parse/run* cycle. This exact solution, however,
//! causes divergence: the instructions we end up executing from the
//! instruction cache, could be completely different to those stored in
//! the block cache, for the same physical address.
//!
//! This can occur due to the differring nature of cache entries between
//! the instruction & block cache: entries in the instruction cache are
//! 1 instruction per slot, whereas in the block cache it's instead a
//! block (a sequence of instructions) per slot. Therefore, an entry
//! getting overriden in the instruction/block cache at address *A*, does
//! not invalidate all instructions in the block cache that correspond
//! to *A*, as they could also exist in blocks at nearby preceding
//! addresses.
//!
//! ## Solution
//!
//! Instead, we introduce the notion of a [`state::PartialBlock`], that can
//! remember that we were executing a _specific_ entry in the block cache
//! - and indeed the progress made.
//!
//! Then, when insufficient steps are remaining to run a block in full,
//! we proceed to run the block anyway, but step-by-step. Once we
//! exhaust any remaining steps, we save progress in a partial block,
//! and execute the remainder of it with [`BlockCache::complete_current_block`]
//! on the next iteration.
//!
//! Since we now guarantee that we always execute the _same_ set of instructions,
//! no matter how many steps are remaining, we solve this possible divergence.
//!
//! # Dispatch
//!
//! The method of dispatch for Blocks can be one of several mechanisms, the current
//! default being [`Interpreted`].
//!
//! [`Interpreted`]: block::Interpreted
