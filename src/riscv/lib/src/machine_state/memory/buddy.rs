//! Buddy-style memory manager
//!
//! Memory managers let you allocate and deallocate memory so it can be re-used later. It removes
//! the need to bookkeep memory allocations from the user, allowing them to only focus on "how much"
//! memory they need.
//!
//! A Buddy allocator employs a tree to represent the allocations across the entire memory range.
//! This allows it to have logarithmic time complexity for finding allocations. This sub-linear
//! complexity is achieved by splitting the memory range into halves, and recursively splitting.
//! Each branch of the tree manages the two halves of its memory range. This splitting stops once we
//! go below a certain memory size for a branch. In this case the branch becomes a leaf which is
//! represented by a bit array where each bit represents the occupancy state of a memory page.
//!
//! See: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddy_memory_allocation>
