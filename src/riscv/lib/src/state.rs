// We cannot compose the implementations of `NewState` for `[T; LEN]` and `Box<_>`. Doing so would
// allocate potentially large arrays on the stack and only then move them to the heap using `Box`.
// This results in potential stack overflow for large arrays.
//
// To avoid this, we implement a combined version `Box<[T; LEN]>` that does not allocate on the
// stack. This makes usage of `NewState::new` safe everywhere as it doesn't sneakily compose
// implementations that would result in stack overflows.
//
// This comes with a small trade-off, we loose out on the `Box<_>` implementation of `NewState`.
// However, this is not a problem since we can always use `Box::new` independently.
