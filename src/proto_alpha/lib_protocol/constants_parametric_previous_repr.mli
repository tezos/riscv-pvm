     the current player by decreasing it by the amount of time she took to play,
     i.e. number of blocks since the opponent last move. See
     {!Sc_rollup_game_repr.timeout} and
     {!Sc_rollup_refutation_storage.game_move} to see the implementation.

     Because of that [timeout_period_in_blocks] must be at least half the upper
     bound number of blocks needed for a game to finish. This bound is
     correlated to the maximum distance allowed between the first and last tick
     of a dissection. For example, when the maximum distance allowed is half the
     total distance [(last_tick - last_tick) / 2] then bound is [Log^2
     (Int64.max_int) + 2 = 65]. See {!Sc_rollup_game_repr.check_dissection} for
